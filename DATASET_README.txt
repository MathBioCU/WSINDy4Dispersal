Here is the diffusion data.  

The experiment took place in a 1.75 m x 1.75 m planter with 45 plants evenly spaced in 5 total rows.  

The genotypes used were either Stonewall (S) or Gasoy (G), which corresponds to a variety with strong constituitive defenses and one with weak defenses, respectively.  

Individual 4th instar fall armyworm where either infected (Inf= yes) or not infected (Inf = no) with virus.  

Check intervals varied and are recorded in the Time column based on hours. 

Q1: is "Individual 1" from Plot 1 on Mar-16 the same worm at all time points, ie. the "Individual" labels corresponds to unique worms?  

Unfortunately, no the individual labels are just tags for that particular time point.  Here is the response from Ben who was in charge of collecting the data:

"I don't think we could record individuals with this design. While sampling it, we could sometimes be quite sure which caterpillar was which (if it stayed in the same place or barely moved for example), but overall since individuals weren't marked we couldn't keep track of them. We also didn't always find the same number from check to check, so there's that limitation as well."

Q2: Also just to make sure I understand, if X=0 or Y=0 then the worm was at one of the boundaries of the plot?

As for the X = 0 and the Y = 0 that is one edge.  The other edge would be X = 175 and Y = 175.  But I don't think the cats bumped up against that edge.  All cats were released in the middle of the plot.

Q3: some of the locations were labelled with stuff like "hamburger" or "burrito", do you or Ben have any sense of what that means?  

'Burrito' in the location field means that they are in a folded leaf, whereas, 'hamburger' means that they are between two leaves.  Nothing special about that location -- just noted if interesting.  The cats that disappeared could have died (they are cannibals), wandering off the edge of the plot, or fell into a soil hole (not big from our perspective but large from theres).

Q4: Also about 135 locations had no entry, do you know what that was signify?  Did any of the cats die during the experiment? I noticed some of the individual counts dropping off at different time points, but at a first pass I just assumed they couldn't be found in the plot.

According to Ben, the blanks are from the June 2015 trial - "I'm not really sure why no microhabitat data is with that. It is possible we didn't collect any since it was a first try maybe?"  I think Ben is right that the first set of data didn't contain the location.  It was added after that trial.

Additionally, since it isn't in the spreadsheet methods, we did limit the time we searched the plot.  According to Ben, "If I recall correctly, we searched each plot for 15 minutes, and we almost always (maybe always?) had three people looking. There is always a compromise between having too much time pass before the last plot gets checked and having around time to find everything. 15 minutes was usually enough time to be pretty sure we counted what we could find, frequently we got basically everything in the first 5-10 minutes and picked up none to a few in the last 5-10." 
 

Q5: Just some other questions that came up while I was thinking about movement models:
*Do you expect the cats to have any X-Y directional preference?  If they're location is on the ground then Vanja was wondering if they would seek out the nearest shade.  Do you think that's the case, and if so do you have any hypotheses about if it would manifest in more diffusion occuring along certain directions in the X-Y plane?
*Same question but for the Z direction, are infected worms more or less likely to climb than their uninfected peers?

In terms of hypotheses being tested, the main ones are: 1) Does resource quality (Gasoy which is low in defenses vs. Stonewall which is high in defenses) affect dispersal? 2) Does infection status affect dispersal? There is some literature that says that infected individuals disperse farther.  3) Along with the interaction between the two.  

As for cat movement preference, I would think that they would prefer to be on a plant rather than out in the open.  The plant provides protection and an opportunity to feed.  As for the Z question, there is some evidence in the literature that infected individuals crawl upward before they die.  It is a cool case of pathogen manipulating the prey to help spread the virus.  That is, if you are higher up, the virus rains down on more leaves when you die and split open.


Q6: Just finally, I was wondering what your guys' intent was for this data.  Did you have a paper in the works that you wanted an analysis for?  Or do you want me to write a short paper with this analysis.

The idea was to have these data as a stand alone on dispersal dynamics and then take the subsequent model and parameter estimates and look at the diffusion of epizootics across the landscape using some of the to be collected hoophouse/macro experiment data.  We currently don't have a paper in the works.  If you want to work on it, that would be great.  I don't think Ben would object since he has a lot on his plate.
